# TicTacToe
Our TicTacToe game

This is the our repository for our Tic Tac Toe game, everyone needs to at least attempt the programming and understand all of 
our code as everyone will be marked on it.

To run the game with the server you need to

1. Run 2 versions of the game on any PC
2. Run the server on 1 PC (Dosn't have to be the same as the game)
3. The server will print the IP and Port
4. From the game click the Game Type, then multiplayer
5. Enter the IP and Port (If you are running the games and server of the same computer then you can leave it black)
6. The first game you connect will go first, the second game that connects may freeze, this is normal just start playing with the first game

Enjoy!
